Three core concept of redux:
Store, action, redux

Three principle of redux:
1. The global state of  app stored as an object inside a store.
2. The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action , an object that describes what happened.
3. To specify how to state tree updated with action, we have to write pure reducers.
